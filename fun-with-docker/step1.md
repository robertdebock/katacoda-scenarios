There are a few commands, give them a try.

`docker ps`{{execute}}
This shows you running containers. There will be none to begin with.

`docker run --help`{{execute}}
Anywhere during the course you can type in `docker [command] --help`.

# Task
Run a container called "hello-world" (hint: `docker run --help`).
