# Well done!

The first task, to install a package, has been added. Time for more tasks.

# Start simple: a service.

The chrony service should be started.

# Code!

Open `tasks/main.yml` and write one extra task that starts the service `chrony` using the `service` module.

Hint: [The documentation of the `service` module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/service_module.html).
