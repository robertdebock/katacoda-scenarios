# Learn to develop Ansible roles

Ansible roles are great, because you can write once, reuse many times, introduce unit-testing, push complexity into roles, keeping your playbook simple.

Let's pretend the environment of your company exists out of these components:

- Fedora 29
- CentOS 7 machines
- Ubuntu 18.04 ([Bionic Beaver](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases))

You've been asked to ensure the times are set correctly on all components.
