# Configurations.

So your role is ready to be tested. Ansible always runs playbooks, that include roles.

We have prepared a few files for you:

- ansible.cfg - The configuration Ansible uses.
- inventory/hosts - The hosts/machines known to Ansible.

# Test the connection!

Try the connection using `ansible -m ping all`{{execute}}
